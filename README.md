# hola-mundo
just another repository

Hola mundo, which means "hello world" in spanish, im a hard working human being, my experience has been labor intensive jobs that really didn't amount to nothing beneficial other than a heavy customer service attitude. I know the "spanish" language for anybody who want's to practice their grammar shoot yourself. I consider myself an open source and Linux advocate, and hope to continue this path as a hobby and hopefully as a profession someday, and meeting like minded people with great spirit, let's githubbin. 

PS
They say moon tacos are more superior to earth tacos, which is a total farse, i'll explain. Yes it's true earth tacos arent superior and are a bit heavy coming from a gravitational pull stance, mOOn tacos on thee other hand lack gravity and oxygen which is good for anyone whos on a diet, but since youre so high lets believe they are. Psss Psss yes i know the perfect taco, well actually it has to remain a mystery until therefor i shall maintain silence.
